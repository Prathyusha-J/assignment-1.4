1. Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail.

(i)Volume –Size of data plays very crucial role in determining value out of data. .

(ii)Variety – Variety always refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. 
	  ex: photos, videos, monitoring devices
(iii)Velocity –The term 'velocity' refers to the speed of generation of data,determines real potential in the data.
(iv)Variability – This refers to the inconsistency and the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.


2. Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data.

The possible solutions to handle bigdata are Hadoop and Cassantra.
Techniques like Scaleup and scale out are also used.


3. Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out

(i)Scaling up, also known as concurrent programming, is one of the  methods for utilizing multi-core architecture in the 
context of a single application. Concurrent programming on multi-core machines is often done through multi-threading.
 
(ii)Scaling out, also known as distributed programming, does something similar by distributing jobs across machines 
    over the network. There are different patterns associated with this model such as Master/Worker, Map/Reduce.
